ARRAY IMPLEMENTATION OF LIST ADT DATE:

AIM: To Write a C++ Program for array implementation of list ADT.

ALGORITHM:

STEP 1: Create nodes first, last, next, prev and cur then set the value as NULL.
STEP 2: Read the list operation type.
STEP 3: If operation type is create then process the following steps.
1.	Allocate memory for node cur.
2.	Read data in cur's data area.
3.	Assign cur node as NULL.
4.	Assign first=last=cur.
STEP 4:	If operation type is Insert then process the following steps.
1.	Allocate memory for node cur.
2.	Read data in cur's data area.
3.	Read the position the Data to be insert.
4.	Availability of the position is true then assing cur's node as first and first=cur.
5.	If availability of position is false then do following steps.
1.	Assign next as cur and count as zero.
2.	Repeat the following steps until count less than postion. 1 .Assign prev as next
2.	Next as prev of node.
3.	Add count by one.
4.	If prev as NULL then display the message INVALID POSITION.
5.	If prev not qual to NULL then do the following steps.
1.	Assign cur's node as prev's node.
2.	Assign prev's node as cur.
STEP 5: If operation type is delete then do the following steps.
1.	Read the position .
2.	Check list is Empty .If it is true display the message List empty.
3.	If position is first.
1.	Assign cur as first.
2.	Assign First as first of node.
3.	Reallocate the cur from memory.
4.	If position is last.
1.	Move the current node to prev.
2.	Cur's node as Null.
3.	Reallocate the Last from memory.
4.	Assign last as cur.
5.	If position is enter Mediate.
1.	Move the cur to required postion.
 

2.	Move the Previous to cur's previous position
3.	Move the Next to cur's Next position.
4.	Now assign previous of node as next.
5.	Reallocate the cur from memory.
STEP 6: If operation is traverse.
1.	Assign current as first.
2.	Repeat the following steps untill cur becomes NULL.


SOURCE CODE:

#include<iostream.h> #include<conio.h> #include<process.h> void create();
void insert(); void deletion(); void search(); void display();
int a,b[20],n,d,e,f,i; void main()
{
int c;
char g='y'; clrscr(); do
{
cout<<"\n Main Menu";
cout<<"\n 1.Create \n 2.Delete \n 3.Search \n 4.insert \n 5.Display \n 6.Exit"; cout<<"\n enter your choice\n";
cin>>c; switch(c)
{
case 1: create(); break; case 2: deletion(); break; case 3: search(); break; case 4: insert(); break; case 5: display(); break; case 6: exit(0); break; default:
cout<<"The given number is not between 1-5\n";
}
 

cout<<"\nDo u want to continue \n"; cin>>g;
clrscr();
}
while(g=='y'|| g=='Y'); getch();
}
void create()
{ cout<<"\n Enter the number\n"; cin>>n;
for(i=0;i<n;i++)
{
cin>>b[i];
}}
void deletion()
{
cout<<"Enter the limit u want to delete \n"; cin>>d;
for(i=0;i<n;i++)
{
if(b[i]==d)
{ b[i]=0;
}}}
void search()
{
cout<<"Enter the limit \n"; cin>>e;
for(i=0;i<n;i++)
{
if(b[i]==e)
{
cout<<"Value found the position\n"<<b[i];
}}}
void insert()
{
cout<<"enter how many number u want to insert \n"; cin>>f;
for(i=0;i<f;i++)
{
cin>>b[n++];
}}
 

void display()
{
cout<<"\n\n\n"; for(i=0;i<n;i++)
{
cout<<"\n\n\n"<<b[i];
} }
OUTPUT:

Main Menu 1.Create 2.Delete 3.Search 4.Insert 5.Display 6.Exit
Enter your choice 1
Enter the number 2
3
4
Do u want to continue
